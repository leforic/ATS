# ATS Suite

## OCR Resume Processing Feature

The ATS Suite now includes OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capability for processing image-based or scanned PDF resumes. This feature enhances the system's ability to extract text from all types of resumes, even when they contain images or are scanned documents.

### Features

- **Text Extraction from Image-Based PDFs**: Uses Tesseract.js to perform OCR on PDF documents that don't contain selectable text
- **Multi-Page OCR Processing**: Can process up to 5 pages of PDF content
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time progress during OCR processing
- **AI-Enhanced OCR Results**: Uses AI to clean and structure OCR-extracted text
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Gracefully handles cases where OCR fails or yields poor results

### Technical Details

- Primary text extraction uses PDF.js to extract text from text-based PDFs
- When text extraction fails, the system falls back to OCR using Tesseract.js
- OCR-processed text is further enhanced with AI to improve structure and readability
- All extracted text is stored in the database, not the actual file

### PDF.js Worker Configuration

The system includes robust handling of PDF.js worker issues:

- **Multiple CDN Fallbacks**: Attempts to load the PDF.js worker from multiple CDNs (unpkg, cdnjs, jsdelivr)
- **Worker Validation**: Automatically validates worker URLs before using them
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to disableWorker mode if worker loading fails
- **Automatic Retries**: Implements a retry mechanism with different worker configurations
- **Timeout Detection**: Uses timeouts to prevent hanging when worker initialization fails

If you encounter PDF.js worker loading issues, the system will automatically:

1. Try to load from the configured CDN
2. Validate the worker URL and try alternative CDNs
3. Fall back to disableWorker mode (slower but more reliable)
4. If text extraction still fails, fall back to OCR processing

### User Experience

- Users are informed that OCR is being performed if their PDF requires it
- Progress indicators show OCR processing status
- Users can cancel long-running OCR operations
- Helpful messages guide users to submit text-based PDFs for the best results

### Performance Considerations

- OCR is computationally intensive and may take longer for complex documents
- Processing is limited to 5 pages maximum to balance thoroughness with performance
- All OCR processing happens in the browser, with no server-side requirements
